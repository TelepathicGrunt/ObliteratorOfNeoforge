NOTE: This is a parody mod! The overwhelming majority of mods may crash with this mod on so do not use for existing worlds! Though there may be a few mods that do with with this mod but things will still be all borked lol.

What's this? A mod using modloader's events as best practice? NOT ANYMORE!!! Too long we have been told "Nooooo!!! Don't use evil weevil mixinies. You must use super special snowflake modloader APIs and events!" Statements spoken by the utterly deranged. And I? I have the cure...

Introducing the shiny, BRAND NEW Obliterator of Neoforge!

Here, witness the awesome power of shutting down the entire Mod Bus and Game Bus!* Minecraft was never meant to harbor public transportation inside! All mods should WALK to the code spot they want to run their code at certain spot by using mixins! What? Do you really think we have the money to pay for all those bus passes? DO YOU THINK MONEY GROWS ON TREES OR SOMETHING?!?!

Furthermore, running mod's logic in events is slow cause no mod writes good code. Trust me, I have first hand personal experience on this with my own mod's codebases! Therefore the solution to get back the speed you all deserve is to simply not run the mod's own code! It's genius! Never before thought of! That's right, this is a TRUE PERFORMANCE MOD!!! PEAK PERFORMANCE!!!

Now you may be thinking, "by gollie, who would ever use this mod???" Good question! Me! I use it! Therefore that question is now invalidated! I fully expect every modpack to ship this mod out by the end of the century. NO EXCEPTION!!

Enjoy you Minecraft world, free of all Neoforge events* that tries to... enforce "mod compatibility". Bleh! Disgusting! Conflicts are the spice of life! Add more spice to your game TODAY!

*All events except for Neoforge's own Mod Bus is stopped. Can't stop Neoforge's Mod Bus without crashing the game. All other mod's Mod Bus is stopped!
