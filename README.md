NOTE: This is a parody mod! The overwhelming majority of mods may crash with this mod on so do not use for existing worlds!

What's this? A mod using modloader's events as best practice? NOT ANYMORE!!!

Introducing the shiny, BRAND NEW Obliterator of Neoforge!

Here, witness the awesome power of shutting down Neoforge's Mod Bus and Game Bus! Minecraft never meant to harbor public transportation inside! All mods should WALK to the code spot they want tor un at by using mixins!

Furthermore, running mod's logic in events is slow cause no mod writes good code. Therefore the solution to get speed is to simply not run the mod's own code! It's genious! Never before thought of! That's right, this is a PERFORMANCE MOD!!! PEAK PERFORMANCE!!!

Now you may be thinking, "by gollie, who would ever use this mod???" Good question! Me! I use it! Therefore that question is now invalidated!!

Enjoy you Minecraft world, free of all Neoforge events* that tries to... enforce "mod compatibility". Bleh! Disgusting! Conflicts are the spice of life!

*All events except for Neoforge's own Mod Bus is stopped. Can't stop Neoforge's Mod Bus without crashing the game. All other mod's Mod Bus is stopped!
